Possible new programs

In this document we can describe some new code ideas which could be implemented in mutiple languages.

Down below describe the working of the program (without diagrams) what the program will do.

Example:
Name: (name)
Description: (What the code should accomplish)
Classes: (Possible classes)
Interesting: (OOP, Multi-threading, etc.)

That last part can determine which languages may not be possible.

Already in repo:
Name: 
  Gearbox
Description: 
  The program should determine the gear you are in with the user input. 
  The program should stop after 10 inputs or q.
  The program should determine the average speed of the user input at the end (without storing the out of boundaries input).
  The program should only accept speed between -30 and 100.
  The program should let the user know if he/she/they go over this limit.
  The program could let the user know what the boundaries are.
Classes: 
  Only main class is needed here.
Interesting:
  I/O
  
Name:
  Schoolsystem
Description:
  The program should be possible to initiate multiple students.
  The program should be possible to initiate multiple subjects.
  The program should be able to have multiple subjects assigned to a student.
  The program should be able to have multiple students follow one subject.
  The program should be able to set grades for a student at a subject.
  The program should keep track of the results of students at a subject.
  The program should keep a grade for a student only for this student.
  The program should be able to calculate the deviation of ... .
  The program should be able to calculate the average grades of a student and show this.
  The program should be able to calculate the average grades in a subject and show this.
  The program should be able to determine if a subject is passed by a student.
  The program should be able to determine if a subject is failed by a student.
  The program should be able to determine if boys or girls did a certain subject better (grade wise).
  The program should be able to calculate the ... of .. .
Classes:
  * App
  * Administration 
  * Student
  * Subject
Interesting:
  * Grades for a subject are student and subject specific.
  * There should be checked on the average grade of subject if student has passed the subject. (Let's use 5.5)
  * There should be check if the student is a boy or a girl to determine who has done better in a certain subject.
  
Name:
  Ships quay
Description:
  * The program should run with multi-threading.
  * The program shall have 3 trucks and 2 cranes minimum (can be changed to fully test it).
  * The program shall when started create 100 containers of randomly chosen (Heated, normal or cooled)
  * The program should be possible to have all the containers safely moved to destination (outside with truck).
  * The program should check if there is room for container on the quay.
  * The program should check if there are still containers left on the ship.
  * The program should have a random delay when carring off the containers to simulate the time it takes for the trucks to be back.
  * The delay shall lay between 1 and 5 seconds.
Classes:
  * App (Main)
  * Containership
  * Crane
  * Quay
  * Truck
  * Container <<Abstract>>
  * HeatedContainer
  * NormalContainer
  * CooledContainer
Interesting:
  OOP, Multi-threading, Abstract
