Possible new programs

In this document we can describe some new code ideas which could be implemented in mutiple languages.

Down below describe the working of the program (without diagrams) what the program will do.

Example:
Name: (name)
Description: (What the code should accomplish)
Classes: (Possible classes)
Interesting: (OOP, Multi-threading, etc.)

That last part can determine which languages may not be possible.
